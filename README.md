This is a Simple Express Application

The application does two things:

1- takes information from the log in form and compare it to the log in information we have in our json file (DataBase in this case) and 
after checking it and see that the information given by the user match it takes you to the profile page of that person in the dataBase.

  What to do to check that it works:
  use `eduardo`as userName and `12345` to take you to `eduardo's page`
  
  
2- when you hit suscribe it is going to take to what we call suscribe page and all it does is that it takes your input and when you hit submit 
in return your input with an image.
